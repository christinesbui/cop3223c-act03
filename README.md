developing the skill of working with arrays

### part 1
write a main function that declares an array of 10 int’s. assign each element in the array a value between 1 and 100 using 10 assignment statements – just make up the values. write a for loop that will print out each of the elements in the array. 

### part 2
start from scratch on each of the parts. write a main function that declares an array of 100 doubles. in a for loop, assign each of the doubles a random number between 0.50 and 50.00.  here’s how: array[i] = (double) (rand() % 100 + 1) / 2.0;\
output the elements of the array in 10 columns that are each 6 spaces wide. each row in the output will have 10 values. the doubles will be printed with 2 places of accuracy past the decimal.

### part 3
write a main function that declares an array of 100 ints. fill the array with random values between 1 and 100. calculate the average of the values in the array. output the average.

### part 4
in a main function declare an array of 1000 ints. fill up the array with random numbers that represent the rolls of a die.  That means values from 1 to 6. write a loop that will count how many times each of the values appears in the array of 1000 die rolls. use an array of 6 elements to keep track of the counts, as opposed to 6 individual variables.\
print out how many times each value appears in the array.
